# GrasscutterGameProvider

Fabric Loader (yes, the Minecraft mod loader) GameProvider for Grasscutter, based on [ExampleGameProvider](https://github.com/PseudoDistant/ExampleGameProvider) by PseudoDistant.

# Why?

I know Grasscutter has its own plugin system, but by using Fabric Loader we can use Mixins to modify GC internals for whatever reason.
