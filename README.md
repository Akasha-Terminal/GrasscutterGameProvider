# ExampleGameProvider

A template that people can use for their own GameProviders, or mod Infinite Tux if you'd like.

If you desperately want to use it for Infinite Tux, get the jar here:
https://github.com/qbancoffee/infinite-tux/releases/tag/1.1sfx
Then rename it to 'game.jar', and launch Knot from the same directory that 'game.jar' is in, with the provider and Fabric's dependencies in the classpath.
